how the practical went. For instance: Was it easy? Was
it hard? 
The first two parts went smoothly,but I found the third one was confusing so I used the  code snippet provide by the professor.
But I still did not take the situation that the random point is right on the boundary.

Were there bits you enjoyed more (or less) than others?
I enjoyed creat some simple method to solve problem than others. For instance, after discusssion with others, I used a forloop to change the 
vaccination rates instead of just repeating the same progress again to change the rate.
What was the most important thing you learned?
The most import thing that I learned is how to simulate and solve real-world problems by using probabilistic models.
